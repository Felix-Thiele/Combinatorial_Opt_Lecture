This program will run on all instances and solve them correctly but due to a suboptimal
 partition class, we get cubic runtime for deleting trees. All instances but ar9152 will 
 run in reasonable time but we strongly strongly advise you to not run ar9152 ;P.

 The by far second slowest instance is pbd984, so we gave the produced output of our
 algorithm in the file solution_for_pbd984.txt.
